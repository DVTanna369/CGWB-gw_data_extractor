# CGWB-gw_data_extractor
This simple UI is meant to extract groundwater data collected by CGWB from the IndiaWRIS site. It bypasses the issues with swagger UI and allows you to download data for a whole district or state or UT in one go. The data is clustered using station code and arranged in chronological order in a csv file.
